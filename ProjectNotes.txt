INTERFACE AND POLYMORPHISM

INTERFACE:

Interface:
    - An interface is like a blueprint that defines methods and properties a class must have but it doesn't provide the actual code for them.
    - It's used to ensure different classes follow the same rules.

Why Use An Interface:
    Abstraction: 
        - Defines what methods a class should implement without specifying how.
        - Interfaces tell classes what they need to do, but not how to do it.
    Polymorphism:
        - Allows different classes to be treated as instances of the interface type.
        - Interface let different classes be used in the same way.
    Decoupling:
        - Reduces dependencies between classes, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.
        - Interfaces help keep classes separate so the code is easier to manage and update.
    Reusability:
        - Ensures that different classes can use comming methods, enhancing code reusability.
        - Interface make it easy to reuse code across different classes.
